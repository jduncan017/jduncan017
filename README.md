# Greetings!

My name is Josh, and Iâ€™m a full-stack developer with a background in sales, marketing, and business development. Additionally, with over seven years of experience spent building and running businesses, I excel in culture building and the management of both people and projects.

As a software engineer, I am passionate about systems design and problem solving. With an aptitude for user experience, I aim to build modern tools to improve the quality of people's lives. I've recently completed a full-stack developer program, and now I'm working to build my portfolio as I switch entirely into tech.

I'm adaptable and ready to learn any language or framework needed to tackle a project, but currently my tech stack of choice is TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML5, and CSS3

- ðŸ”­ **What I'm up to:** Iâ€™m currently immersing myself in a software development course at TripleTen University. I'm learning, growing, and loving every minute of it!

- ðŸŒ± **What I'm learning:** I'm diving headfirst into Next.js, enhancing my skills in building efficient, modern web applications.

- ðŸ‘¯ **Collaboration interests:** Iâ€™m intrigued by AI, especially its applications in Crypto and Sustainable Agriculture. If you're working on something related, let's connect and see how we can make a difference together!
