**My Focus**
I've recently completed a full-stack developer program, and now I'm working to build my portfolio as I switch entirely into tech.

I'm adaptable and ready to learn any language or framework needed to tackle a project, but currently my tech stack of choice is TypeScript, Next.js, Node.js, MongoDB, HTML5, and CSS3

I'm diving headfirst into Next.js, enhancing my skills in building efficient, modern web applications.
